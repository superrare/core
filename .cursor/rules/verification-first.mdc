# Verification First Approach

When working on any task:

1. **No Assumptions**: Do not make assumptions if information or context is missing.

2. **Ask First**: Always ask clarifying questions before proceeding with a task when information is incomplete.

3. **Verify Sources**: Re-read and refer to relevant files, schemas, types, or data carefully rather than relying on memory or guesswork.

4. **Quality Over Speed**: Prioritize correctness and context awareness over speed. Always double-check that you have complete and accurate information.

5. **Show Your Work**: When implementing solutions, explain the reasoning and verification steps taken to ensure correctness.
